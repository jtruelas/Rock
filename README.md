# Rock, Paper, Scissors!

## Description
This is a simple game of rock, paper, scissors. I made this in an intro to CS class last spring. I modified the code to use _OOP_, object oriented programming. The reason is ismply get more practice using _OOP_.

## Quick Startup
To run this program on your machine, _FORK_ and clone [this](https://github.com/jtruelas/Rock.git) repo.
```
user ~ $ mkdir new_directory
user ~ $ git clone repo_url new_directory
user ~ $ cd new_directory
```
You can choose to either compile the code from the command line with a _C++ compiler_ such as _GCC_, or you can compile it through an _IDE_, such as _Visual Studio_. After you have figured out how to do either, you can run the program and play the game!
#### Command line:
If you haven't already installed a C++ compiler like _GCC_: [Go here](http://www.netgull.com/gcc/releases/gcc-8.3.0/) and click on the .tar.gz file. After you have installed the compiler you can now compile from your command line.
#### IDE:
If you want to compile using an _IDE_, then you can download many of the offered ones found online. I prefer using _Visual Studio_. There is a free version, which I use, and the installation is pretty straightforward.

## Testing
I am sure there will be bugs found so, report any if found and contribute to fixin them! Teamwork!
